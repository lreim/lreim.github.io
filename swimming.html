            Butterfly is my favourite swimming style. 
            I even got to the Northern Germany Championships with Butterfly thanks to my excellent trainer Andreas KÃ¼hnapfel with only 
            three training per week.

            Sadly, the new university life made my old life vanish from one minute to another and I do'nt pursue competitive swimming 
            anymore. I try to go more this semester.

            And do you know, what I love about swimming (next to the fact, that I grew old with it)? The everyday life is so loud, rushed, noisy, 
            distracting -  but when you swim, you only hear the soft water floating anlongside your years (and your trainer...), you can 
            just disappear, dive into the embracing water and let yourself float. Float or glide with strength through the waves of water.
