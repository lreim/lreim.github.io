                Butterfly is my favorite swimming style. I even made it to the Northern Germany Championships with Butterfly, 
                thanks to my excellent coach Andreas Kühnapfel, despite only training three times a week.

                Sadly, the new university life caused my old routine to vanish in the blink of an eye, and I no longer pursue 
                competitive swimming. I’m trying to swim more this semester, though.

                And do you know what I love most about swimming (besides the fact that I grew up with it)? Everyday life is so loud, 
                rushed, noisy, and distracting – but when you swim, you only hear the soft sound of the water flowing alongside 
                you (and your coach, of course). You can simply disappear, dive into the embracing water, and let yourself float. 
                Float or glide powerfully through the waves.
