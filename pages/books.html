    <p>
        I recently got inspired by the website of Sarah Zerbes (my Linear Algebra Professor at ETH) to add a list of books I enjoyed reading. 
        And since I think books are unbelievably important for (also our personal) life and we should read more (I know, it's difficult sometimes and I
        still find myself skipping my reading time due to time lack..., I am currently working on implementing a good "book routine hygiene" ;))
        here it is:
        <li>Never split the difference, by Chris Voss</li>
        <li>Einsteins Schleier, Anton Zeilinger</li>
        <li>Kinderb√ºcher von Lucy und Stephen Hawking ;)</li>
