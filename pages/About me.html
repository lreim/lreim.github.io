<p>Hi, that's me :)</p>
<p>
    Hi, I'm Lissy.
    I'm 18 years old and currently studying Physics at ETH Zürich — to answer all my questions about how the world works. Or in other words: “Was die Welt im Innersten zusammenhält.”
    We've just started diving into Special Relativity, and with every step I take, I grow more certain that physics is what I want to truly understand. Or rather — try to. “Understanding” is a big word. Honestly, I hope I'll never fully understand the world.
    Not because I think science takes away the wonder — quite the opposite. I believe science adds to the beauty, to the mystery, to the sense of awe. I do hope that someday humanity will understand everything around us — but I'm glad that I personally never will.
    Already now, what we can explain is too much for any single person to fully grasp. And that, to me, is incredibly exciting. You can feel like a newborn every single day.
    I also love this idea: that we're dependent on other minds — on each other — to connect the pieces we've uncovered and make sense of the world. Science is the perfect example of teamwork, and of what becomes possible when we work together.
    That's why I believe we need more focus on science, on scientific thinking — and most importantly: on listening to science.

    But that's enough for now. I'm also passionate about a few other things.
    I believe people should explore more. Try more. Learn different things. We're too versatile as humans to reduce ourselves to one single passion.
    That doesn't mean I prefer variety over depth — not at all. I love depth. I love asking thoughtful questions and exploring what lies underneath, discovering details and understanding structures.
    So, a few of my passions:
    I love playing the <a href="Piano.html">piano</a>.
    I've been <a href="swimming.html">swimming</a> for as long as I can remember.
    I adore <a href="dancing.html">dancing</a> (Latin and Standard)
    I'm passionate about <a href="photography.html">photography</a> — especially of the sky (not deep-sky yet, but someday)
    And I'm deeply into <a href="https://gedankenwelten.substack.com">writing</a> — reflective, thoughtful writing, full of questions, thoughts, and wonderings.
    I question myself a lot. Reflect on what moves my mind, what I struggle with, what I feel about the world, and how I see it. From physics to philosophy — I enjoy exploring both the measurable and the immeasurable.
    If you see yourself in this, feel free to take a look at my writing. Let your thoughts float, resonate, or even rebel against mine — that's what makes thinking fun.
</p>

    What else is there to know?
    I'm always trying to improve myself — which isn't always a good thing.
    But I strive to be the best version of me. To follow what sparks my curiosity, not let the flame die out, and to stay in love with the world and its wonders.
    So — who are you?
    Send me an e-mail if you'd like to discuss questions of any kind, go for a run, or give me feedback on this site. I'd love to hear from you. :)
