        It all started with my grandpa having a photo shop where my dad helped and learned as I then did from him. 
        I still remember the christmas when I got my first camera, inherited by my dad. I took photos the whole evening, bad exposure and shutter speed
        but lots of fun.

        And from that on I fulilled the role of the family's personal phtographer for holidays and events together with my father. 
        I improved and went outside a lot shooting nature's beautiful motives. (since we do fortunately lived in a little village next to a lake and forest)
        I found passion in photographing the smallest and biggest, most fragile and most vast and robust. (or maybe rather instable?)
        Macro of nature's little creatures, flowers, patterns we usually wouldn't notice; and the one thing maybe everyone looks upon: the sky, the stars
        the moon the blinking patterns we can find there.

        Some years later I took my first self potrait.
        I found interest in experimenting with shutter speed and thus kind of layering of images just with one shot. 

        Because, personally, I didn't want to edit my photos a lot. I liked them to be natural, with no extra effects (except for the cases it was intention in order
        to create different kind of art). Because extremely intense edited photos can definitely be art! But I think thant should be set apart from 
        photography itself. There are different kinds of photography, every subpart has its reasons to exist, but they should be separated, labelled differently.
        Long story short, I try to make my photos as natural as possible, but sometimes I like to make dffernet kind of art of it. 

        To come back to the portraits: I like to tell stories with them, to create visual Anregungen for thinking just as in essays. Which doesn't mean That
        the message must be obviuos but rather open for the recipient to let her resonate with it in the way she want to, the way she interprets it. 
        Here is one example:
