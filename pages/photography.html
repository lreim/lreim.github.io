            It all started with my grandpa, who had a photo shop where my dad helped out and learned — just as I later did from him. 
            I still remember the Christmas when I got my first camera, inherited from my dad. I took photos the whole evening — bad exposure, wrong shutter speed — 
            but lots of fun.

            From then on, I took on the role of the family’s personal photographer for holidays and events, alongside my father. 
            I got better over time and spent a lot of time outside, capturing nature’s beautiful scenes 
            (luckily, we lived in a small village next to a lake and forest). 
            I found a passion for photographing the smallest and the biggest, the most fragile and the most vast and robust — or maybe rather unstable?
            Macros of nature’s tiny creatures, flowers, patterns we’d usually overlook; and the one thing maybe everyone looks up to: the sky, the stars, 
            the moon, the blinking patterns we can find there.

            Some years later, I took my first self-portrait.  
            I became interested in experimenting with shutter speed — and in that way, kind of layering images within a single shot.

            Personally, I didn’t want to edit my photos much. I liked them natural, with no added effects — except when the intention was to create a different kind of art. 
            Because highly edited photos can absolutely be art! But I believe that should be seen as something separate from photography itself. 
            There are different branches of photography, and each has its reasons to exist — but they should be labeled and treated differently.

            Long story short: I try to keep my photos as natural as possible, but sometimes I enjoy creating a different kind of art from them.

            Coming back to portraits: I like to tell stories with them, to create visual impulses for thought — like an essay in image form. 
            That doesn’t mean the message has to be obvious, but rather open — something the viewer can resonate with in their own way, 
            interpreting it however they want to.
