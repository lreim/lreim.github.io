    <p>Welcome to my personal website :)</p>

    <p>Whether you landed here by accident or on purpose, I'm genuinely glad you're here. 
        I warmly invite you to click around and explore my life a little ‚Äì get to know me!</p>
    <p>You might be wondering: why even have a website?</p>
    <p>Not long ago, I was one of those people thinking:</p>
    <p>The internet is so vast, chaotic, and overwhelming ‚Äì what difference would my little website make in this huge digital space? More importantly, 
        who am I to even have one? Who would want to visit my page, let alone find it? I used to think websites were for important people ‚Äì 
        people who need one for career reasons or something similar. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        But, recently I got convinced by my friends that websites are pretty cool. 
        <p>
            <li>It's cool ‚Äî because of the little side project you can make out of it: coding and designing it exactly the way you want.</li>
            <li>It's cool ‚Äî because of the freedom it gives you. You're free to create your own website in the vastness of the web.</li>
            <li>It's cool ‚Äî because it's your own little digital home. A home for thoughts, creativity, a tiny sharepoint, and personal archive.</li>
            <li>It's cool ‚Äî because you don‚Äôt let yourself be intimidated by the "meaninglessness" you might feel when creating a website that seems irrelevant.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            So ‚Äî there are so many good reasons to start building your own little, simple, maybe even plain website right now.  
            Your personal space, your niche on the web. ;)
