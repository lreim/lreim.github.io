    <p>Welcome to my personal website :)</p>

    <p>Whether you landed here by accident or on purpose, I'm genuinely glad you're here. 
        I warmly invite you to click around and explore my life a little ‚Äì get to know me!</p>
    <p>You might be wondering: why even have a website?</p>
    <p>Not long ago, I was one of those people thinking:</p>
    <p>The internet is so vast, chaotic, and overwhelming ‚Äì what difference would my little website make in this huge digital space? More importantly, 
        who am I to even have one? Who would want to visit my page, let alone find it? I used to think websites were for important people ‚Äì 
        people who need one for career reasons or something similar. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        But, recently I got convinced by my friends that websites are pretty cool. 
        <li>Cool because of the little side project you can make out of it when coding and designing it the way you want it to</li>
        <li> cool because of the freedom you have, you are free to make your own website in the vast web</li> 
        <li>cool because it's your own little digital home, home for thoughts, for creativity, a little sharepoint and archive</li> 
        <li>cool because you don't let yourself feel intimidated by the meaninglessness you might have with your irrelevant website.</li> 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, many great reasons to start just now building your little, spare, plain website; your personal space, nieche in the web. ;)
