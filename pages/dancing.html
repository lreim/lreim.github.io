        Like almost every teenager, I took dance classes during my last years of high school. 
        At first, it was just the basics, but since I had so much fun with my talented ex-boyfriend, 
        we decided to continue and eventually joined the formation group of the dance school we had always admired. 
        We had a great time learning new dances and performing together as a team.

        When I moved to Zurich for university, I was really sad to lose the joy dancing had brought me. 
        But luckily, on the very first day I joined a university dance class, I met an incredibly talented guy who became a good friend.  
        I'm so grateful to him—he taught me countless dance moves and basically introduced me to salsa and bachata (which might now 
        be my favorite styles). Thanks to him, my passion for dancing didn't fade away.

        Then university life hit me hard. As a perfectionist and constant optimizer, I didn't allow myself time for hobbies anymore. 
        (Big mistake — but some lessons you only learn by doing the opposite.)  
        Now I'm finally happy to be dancing again and enjoying the freedom it brings.  
        Dancing gives you so much body awareness, lets you see your movements in a new light, and frees you from feeling stuck in 
        a stiff, unchanging shell.  
        I'm sure that if you give it a try, you'll FEEL how dancing truly makes you feel.
